Building AI Course Project
# AI-Powered Job Recovery Coach with Career Development Planning

## Project Idea
A national-level AI assistant that helps unemployed individuals in Finland find suitable work within three months while building a personalized long-term career roadmap. It simulates different job paths based on real labor market demand, offers realistic weekly action plans, and integrates with public services. Unlike typical job boards, this coach provides dynamic feedback, reskilling plans, and goal tracking tailored to each user.

## Background
While many platforms offer job listings or career advice separately, few combine urgent placement with strategic planning in a locally relevant way. Finland has high unemployment in certain regions, and job seekers often face confusion about what jobs to pursue or what skills are actually in demand. This tool addresses that by focusing on rapid recovery and future growth â€” all in one assistant.

## Data and AI Techniques

### Data Sources
- Public job listings (TE Services, Duunitori, Oikotie)
- Real-time labor demand from Statistics Finland
- Skill and occupation taxonomies (ESCO, O*NET)
- Local educational offerings and reskilling programs
- User-submitted CVs and preferences

### AI Techniques
- NLP to process job ads and extract skills
- Job-user matching via recommender systems
- Clustering for visualizing career pivot paths
- Predictive models for job success likelihood
- GPT-based chatbot to deliver progress feedback, simulate career choices

## Usage Context
**Primary Users**: Unemployed or underemployed Finns (career changers, recent graduates, immigrants)  
**Secondary Users**: Public employment offices, municipalities, career counselors

### Features
- Short-term job matches based on skill fit and location
- A personalized 3-month job search plan
- Long-term career roadmap with suggested upskilling
- Weekly feedback based on real-time job market updates
- Simulations of "what if I learn X" scenarios

## Challenges
- Reliance on local labor market data and integration with government systems
- Motivating continuous user engagement
- Ensuring feedback is realistic, not overly optimistic
- Avoiding algorithmic bias in career suggestions

## What Next
- Connect to municipality support systems (benefits, training subsidies)
- Build weekly email/SMS progress nudges
- Add salary and employment stability forecasts
- Launch pilot with city-level employment centers
- Support multilingual users and low-digital-literacy groups

## Acknowledgments
- Public data from Statistics Finland and TE Services
- Skills datasets from O*NET and ESCO
- Tools and libraries: spaCy, scikit-learn, OpenAI GPT
- Inspired by Finnish EdTech efforts and social impact AI projects
